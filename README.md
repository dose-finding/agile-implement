BLRM-Randomised-AGILE-SIMULATIONS.R
This code uploads the required functions and implements the 2-parameter logistic (also known as BLRM) randomised design in the case of a single-agent trial with binary (DLT/no DLT) outcomes.

This code can be used to produce the performance of the proposed design provided in Table 3.
